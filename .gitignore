# This file has been made to avoid committing large datasets and feature files to GitHub. 

data/features/
# This directory contains extracted feature files (e.g., HOG, PCA) 
# which are large in size and can be regenerated from the raw data if needed.

data/processed/
# This folder stores preprocessed image files (e.g., grayscale, resized, denoised),
# which are large and can be recreated using the preprocessing pipeline.

models/*.pkl
# These .pkl files contain serialized machine learning models which are too large for 
# GitHub’s 100MB file limit and can be retrained from source if needed.

*.pkl
# This rule captures all other pickle files that may store intermediate data, 
# trained models, or large arrays, often exceeding GitHub's recommended size limits.
